        <p>I have learned HTML in the past in highschool, but its 
        been well over 2 years now. I am a bit rusty, but im sure 
        ill pick it up easily as we continiue through the course. 
        I also have some experience in Java, as well as Python.</p>
        
        <p>I own a cat named Mocha, who is a tortie. She is crazy 
        and loves to wake me up at 3 am. I also have a ball python 
        named Jeffery who is being taken care of by someone else
        while im in college.</p>
